note: sgminer is not my work and I claim no rights or ownership. I made this package so that people who wish to GPU mine Chaincoin would be able to have a solid starting point and no hassles. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a GPU miner for Chaincoin, which was one of the first (if not the very first) cryptocurrency to employ  an algorithm that 'chains' together 11 different hashing functions. The algorithm for Chaincoin is called C11. 

Shortly after Chaincoin, a coin was made called Xcoin, which soon changed their name to Darkcoin. 

So long story short, Darkcoin's success is partly due to it's X11 algorithm, which was pioneered by Chaincoin. 

Chaincoin is very GPU efficient - running this miner the settings provided in the SOLO and POOL .bat files, my single MSi R9 280X produces a hashrate of 2.2 Mh/s at a nice cool 63.0 degrees Celsius.


I have also included a HELP.bat file which, when run, will provide you with all the command line options to choose from when you want to make your own .bat files.

Enjoy!!!   

And if this package helped you start mining Chaincoins with GPU's, please consider a small tip/donation!
